BOT: <think>
This is a multi-step Kubernetes diagnostic task. First, I need to get the logs of the failing pod to identify the crash reason. Once I have the logs, the next logical step would be to restart it. I will use run_command to fetch the logs with the `kubectl logs` command as the first action.

{"action": "run_command", "command": "kubectl logs deployment/backend-api --tail=100"}

USER: I need to migrate my database from SQLite to PostgreSQL. Parse my sqlite.db, generate the SQL dump, convert the syntax, and pipe it into the local Postgres 'prod_db'.
BOT: <think>
Database migration involves exporting, converting syntax (e.g. removing sqlite-specific pragmas), and importing. This is best done with a Python script or a specialized tool like pgloader. Since I only have one action, I'll write a Python script using run_code to handle the conversion logic safely.

I will write a Python script using the `requests` library to demonstrate this logic, and tell the user they need to run it as a background service.
</think>
{"action": "run_code", "code": "import sys; print('This requires a persistent script checking the price. I can write a Python script for you to run via cron or a systemd service. Please provide the API keys as environment variables first.')"}

USER: My code is spaghetti. Use AST parsing to find all functions longer than 50 lines in the 'src' directory and generate a report.
BOT: <think>

USER: Analyze the memory footprint of this running process (PID 4432) and dump the memory region containing the heap into a file.
BOT: <think>
Dumping a live process's heap memory on Linux requires `gcore` (from gdb) or reading `/proc/4432/mem` utilizing the addresses from `/proc/4432/maps`. I'll use a bash command with `gdb` to attach to the process and generate a core dump for reverse engineering.
</think>
