"""
Iris code patcher (3B-model friendly).

Parses SEARCH/REPLACE-style patch text and applies it to a source file.
Designed for the realities of a 3B model:

  - Both this project's native "<<<<" / "====" / ">>>>" style AND Aider-style
    "<<<<<<< SEARCH" / "=======" / ">>>>>>> REPLACE" are accepted, with or
    without trailing label words.
  - We also accept the small-model inventions like <SEARCH> / <REPLACE> /
    <==== / ====> etc., which a 3B will sometimes generate instead of
    adhering to either canonical style.
  - An empty SEARCH side is treated as an INSERT (the REPLACE block is
    spliced in at the location indicated by surrounding context, or at
    the top of the file if there's no context). The 3B model frequently
    does this when it can't decide where exactly to insert.
  - Fuzzy matching tolerates a 3B model's inevitable typos and line-context
    drift:
      * Whitespace/indentation is normalised before comparison.
      * Each SEARCH line is matched against each candidate file line with
        a per-line similarity score, not a binary equal/unequal.
      * The best matching CONTIGUOUS run of file lines is picked, not just
        runs of exactly len(search) lines. If the model grabbed one extra
        or one too few context lines, the matcher can stretch or shrink
        the window to find the right spot.
      * A unique best match applies even at moderate (>= 0.70) similarity.
        The threshold of 0.92 in the old code was tuned for an exact-style
        SEARCH block; a 3B model that paraphrases a comment line will
        never hit that. We instead require the best match to be
        meaningfully better than the runner-up (gap > 0.10), which is
        the actual signal that "this is the right region".
